> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CoBridge explicitly requires the [Gemini Voyager](https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/gemini-voyager) browser extension to work.**
> CoBridge handles context reception in the IDE, while Gemini Voyager captures context from the web interface. Together, they enable seamless context synchronization!

**Brainstorming with AI on the web, coding in the IDE — yet they seem to have forgotten each other?**

CoBridge is that "Dimensional Bridge": it instantly transports your chat history from the browser to your IDE, allowing AI assistants like Copilot, Trae, and Cursor to understand your thought process.

> Brain in the cloud, hands on local — breathing in sync.

## 🚀 Three Steps to Take Off

### 1. Install CoBridge

Open the VS Code Extension Marketplace, search for **CoBridge**, and click install. It's that simple.

### 2. Confirm Service Status

After installation, glance at the status bar in the bottom right corner — seeing `CoBridge: On` means the bridge is ready (default port `3030`).

![Running Status](images/running.png)

Clicking this icon allows you to:
- Manually **Start/Stop** the service
- **View Logs** (Check here if issues arise)
- **Open Sync File** (See what the AI remembers)
- **Clear Sync File** (Wipe the AI's memory)

### 3. Start "Memory Teleportation"

Ensure **Gemini Voyager** in your browser has "Context Sync" enabled. Click **Sync to IDE**, and the conversation content will automatically land in:

```
.cobridge/AI_CONTEXT.md
```

From now on, your IDE assistant will never look at you blankly and ask, "What did you say before?"

## ⚙️ Port Occupied? Change It!

If the default port `3030` is "hogged" by another program, changing it is easy:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl + ,` / `Cmd + ,`)
2. Search for `AIContextSync.port`
3. Change the port number to your preference (e.g., `3031`)
4. Restart the service from the status bar menu, and you're done!

**Since VS Code workspace settings override user settings, please modify the port number in your Workspace Settings.**

## 📋 Prerequisites

| Requirement | Description |
|------|------|
| **VS Code** | `1.50.0` or higher |
| **Browser Extension** | Requires the companion [Gemini Voyager](https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/gemini-voyager) to capture conversations |
| **Network** | Ensure `127.0.0.1` is not blocked by a firewall |

---

## 🎯 Principles

- **Zero Pollution**: CoBridge automatically adds the sync file to `.gitignore`, ensuring it never pollutes your Git repository. Your "whispers" stay with you.
- **Friendly Format**: Full Markdown output, making it as smooth for your IDE AI to read as a manual.
- **Auto Configuration**: It also helps update rule files, allowing various AI assistants to seamlessly read the context.

## ⚠️ Known Quirks

| ✅ **Supported** | Gemini |
| ✅ **Table Support** | Table synchronization is supported |
| ✅ **Image Support** | Image synchronization is supported |
| ❌ **Not Supported** | Platforms with strict anti-scraping or complex DOM structures (PRs welcome!) |
| ❌ **File Attachments** | Not yet supported |

## 🌟 TL;DR

**LLMs will no longer have amnesia. Discuss solutions thoroughly on the web, and implement them directly in the IDE.**
